Rust `std` modules with impacted functionality:
- arch - SIMD and vendor intrinsics module.
    - Technically available but in practice unusable (it is almost entirely `unsafe`)
- fs - Filesystem manipulation operations.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results (e.g. `is_file` always returns `false`)
- io - Traits, helpers, and type definitions for core I/O functionality.
    - Works on a case-by-case basis (usable with e.g. `Vec<u8>`, not with files).
- net - Networking primitives for TCP/UDP communication.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- os - OS-specific functionality.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- process - A module for working with processes.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
- ptr - Manually manage memory through raw pointers.
    - Technically available but in practice unusable (it is almost entirely `unsafe`)
- thread - Native threads.
    - May panic, return `Err("unsupported operation")`, or have arbitrary results.
